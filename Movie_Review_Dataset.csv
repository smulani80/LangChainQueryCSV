1,2012,9,1,"I have to say this movie is very tense. The disasters in it make you think, will the world really end this way? It's one of those films where it gets your mind thinking about the world around us and how natural disasters can and will happen.
The reason I give 2012 a 9 is it is a film where it makes you think, it makes you think about being prepared for disasters great or small, basically it's a movie about reality but its fiction. Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, a real edge of your seat type of deal. For one the natural disasters in the film can happen anytime, for example, the yellow stone caldera is a real super volcano that scientists and geologist have been studying. They do say it will erupt again in the future, but they don't know when? as for the earthquakes those are real, the shifting of continents? I guess a major event like that can happen? It did millions of years ago.
I for one liked the action in it, I also liked the fact that there was humor in it to break the ice of all the seriousness and drama. All the cast does a wonderful job, Danny Glover was excellent playing the President of the United States. John Cusack was good, but I feel they should have put a more action packed actor in it as the dad who saves his family, Cusack does not have action in him, but then again like I said he did a good job in the movie.
My favorite character was the crazy guy that was obsessed with the Yellow stone caldera, he made me laugh so much. But then again he was completely crazy and lost his life because of it. I feel like Gordon played by Tom McCarthy should have had a better ending to his life, like to save someone. The movie also makes me think about this, in times of disaster and dire need, how will we act towards other human beings? If we were on three boats, trying to survive, would we open the gates and let others in? Or leave them? Makes you think about your compassion and humanity.
2012 is a thinking movie, it will not only make you jump out of your seat but it will get your mind moving about things. Makes you want to get emergency prepared as well. I give 2012 a 9.",,,,,,
2,2012,10,1,"2012 (2009) is a science fiction film disaster that was released on 13 November 2009. Telling about the mayan prediction that will predict the earth will experience devastating disaster on December 21, 2009. Jackson frustrated man rescues his family from the catastrophic catastrophe that destroyed the whole world. Very good disaster movie. Stunning CGI effects. Excellent acting ... Forget about the story .. Enjoy ",,,,,,
3,2012,3,0," I like John Cusack. He usually makes some pretty good movies. This movie is a dog. I know movies stretch the imagination, but this one wants you to remove you head and not even think. The physics are just WAAAAAAY to hard to believe. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are nowhere near as big as they are in this movie. And its just a stupid plot all together. ",,,,,,
4,2012,10,1,"LMAO!!!!! Are you some kind of boring 90 year old man????? This has to be the worst review I think I've read on here and I've read a few! You're moaning about Close Calls???? IT'S CALLED GOD DAMN TENSION IT WAS THE WHOLE FUN OF IT! It kept you in the edge of your seat! Every bloody film has CLOSE CALLS. James Bond is probably the ultimate one which abuses this to the MAX yet it is fantastic! If this was meant to be REALISTIC as you think it should have been. Then they wouldn't have made it off the bloody runway and then they'd be a completely blank film without the main characters.
Flippen hell you must be the worst person to see a film with. My opinion on this film wasn't the best of story lines, but the Director said himself in many interviews that he didn't want this film to be deadly serious, he just wanted to deliver entertainment and to just bring a bit of humour to the situation otherwise it'll be quite a depressing film. Might as well call it Shindlers List 2 or whatever.
I found it extremely entertaining and I got my money's worth out of it. There was a lot of character development but it isn't Batman you're watching here it's the end of the world lol.
I went thru nearly every emotion. Happy, Sad, Terrified, Anger. No other film has made me go through so many emotions and those films are supposed to be called ""Epic and Memorable"" ",,,,,,
5,2012,4,0,"When I thought about all the hoopla that surrounded the release of this film, I figured that the film would delve into the Mayan culture (which predicts the now-infamous world-ending date) and how people of the Earth would interpret in during that fateful year. Instead, I got a disaster film...nothing more.
Of course, if you a fan of the ""disaster film"" genre, then this may be one of the best films you see all year. The special effects are incredible, and action is non-stop, and a few scenes (like the crumbling of the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brazil) that are iconic. It compares favorable to other movies of its type, including ""Titanic"" and ""Cloverfield"".
Where this film falls short of those films, though, is that fact that its appeal ends at ""disaster"". The characters (at least the main ones) are almost blatantly ripped off from ""War of the Worlds"" (the Tom Cruise version) in terms of family dynamics, and by the end of the film you still don't find yourself really rooting for them with any heartfelt emotion. Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story. As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the ""Arks"" are chosen. What could have been a fascinating character study in humanity instead is completely glossed-over by explosions and destruction. Imagine The Dark Knight without The Joker, and you pretty much get the picture.
Thus, unless you are a huge fan of incredible special effects and prolonged action sequences, I would advise you to skip this effort, as it just doesn't bring any more to the table than that. ",,,,,,
6,2012,7,1,"Good movie but not the BEST.
The special effects were OK, some of them looked really fake.
I know it's an action movie and the principal cast are supposed to survive 'till the end of the movie but come on, were they supernatural or what? Only few scratches after all they went through. The bridges and buildings falling down and they passed in the car with no problem. It could be a little more realistic without all the drama: ""we survive to everything no matter what"".
I suffered a lot watching this movie, I was struggling with myself to not cry, it's very cruel and it's sad imagine all this could really happen, see how everyone dies, everything is destroy and it shows once again how the people in this world thinks: the money and being an ""important"" person can save your life, the rest of us does not matter.
It's also a wake up call to everyone who lives in this planet. ",,,,,,
7,2012,1,0,"A typical Roland Emmerich movie - I expect his next oeuvre will feature special effects only and dispense with characters, story line and actors altogether. They certainly were undetectable in this one! Dumb and dumber was a celebration of wit and character development compared with this tripe. It seems that computer technology is sufficient for producing a blockbuster nowadays - I'm sure it made many millions.
No spoiler alert as the ""plot""line and photos tell the whole story. What on earth were John Cusack and Woody Harrelson thinking? Bet they look back on this one cringing furiously...
I remember watching the original ""Titanic"" and ""Poseidon Adventure"" a long time ago and they both seem like in-depth documentaries in comparison - and that's saying a lot! LOL ",,,,,,
8,2012,6,1,"2012 really is a mixed bag. I liked the actors and their performances, including Amanda Peet, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and more. The special effects are also pretty great, it should be, that's what the whole movie is supposed to thrive off of. Now where this film does fall kinda short is the writing. To be completely honest, the dialogue between the characters isn't all that great, just not too creative. Great effects and even good actors unfortunately cannot make up for weak writing. The movie did have some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up nearly as much to what it could've been. There are some interesting scenes involving prophecy and the telling of the end times in the beginning of the movie. Although I did think that Harrelson's performance was a bit too crazy and overly comical. So basically 2012 is a mediocre end of times disaster film with pretty good performances by good actors with less than average writing. 6/10 for 2012. ",,,,,,
9,2012,2,0,"I generally like Roland Emmerich's movies. They're not great but they're fun. I thought Stargate, Independence Day, and even Godzilla, were decent movies. But I didn't particularly like 2012. There's really only one reason I didn't like it but it's a big reason: the film gives you no reason for you to care more about the main characters than the billions of other people who die. Yes, tons of innocent people die in other disaster movies, like Independence Day and Dante's Peak (probably my favorite disaster movie), but the vast majority of the human race isn't killed in those. I didn't care about the family. I did care about Gordon (he was the one who flew them out of danger in the first place, after all) and he's crushed in the gears of the ark. In fact, quite a few of the people who are responsible, both directly and indirectly, for saving the family are killed, like Woody Harrelson's character, the Russian billionaire and pilot, and the astrophysicist.
And I think one disaster movie cliche that needs to die is how a dog is given more attention than all the people who are dying as if an animal's life is more important than a human's. Again, Independence Day and Dante's Peak are also guilty of this and I didn't like it in those movies either. ",,,,,,
10,2012,9,1,"I am surprised that at this moment, this film only got a 5.6 rating. I was going to rate it 8, but now I am rating it a 9.
I loved it its intense special effects, and its intense sound effects. After all, that is what big disaster movies are all about.
The storyline may not be very strong, but it is supposed to entertain us. And I was truly entertained for over two hours. This is a movie well done. There was a few dull moments, but overall, it is big.
I watched it on DVD, I should have watched it in a big theater with a big screen. The special effects were purely amazing! One problem with this movie is its lack of Chinese people. After all, the ships were supposed to be built in China. There was no Chinese leaders or many Chinese people shown in the movie. ",,,,,,
11,Avatar,9,1,"A paraplegic marine dispatched to the moon Pandora on a unique mission becomes torn between following his orders and protecting the world he feels is his home. When it comes to movies such as 'Titanic' or 'Avatar' i simply can't ignore the fact that those 2 films are kinda ""forgettable"" when you compare them with other much better James Cameron films such as 'The Terminator' or 'Terminator 2' or even better 'Aliens' but after seeing 'Avatar' once again i gotta say this film is actually pretty good. Avatar has some really good cgi although not 100% believable James Cameron created a nicely beautiful World with some good and interesting Characters inside it, the acting is also really good by mostly everyone especially Sam Worthington although i felt that Stephen Lang's character was getting annoying after a while. The aircrafts that they use threw out the movie do look like the HK's from T1 and T2 a bit if you think about it and those giant cool looking robots were kinda inspired by Matrix Revolutions (2003) and even that old Superman Cartoon from the 90's. Now where the film kinda struggles is when it comes to it's pacing because the whole 1st act and half of the 2nd act do get a bit slow and although it doesn't completely hurt the film it is still an issue but thankfully the movie picks up from the end of the 2nd half all the way threw the 3rd and personally best act of the movie where it basically turns into a giant war against Blue Aliens and Humans. Many people said that this film isn't quite original and that it mixed Dances with Wolves (1990) with Aliens (1986) and Smurfs and in a way it does in fact mix a lot of different films but that isn't such a big problem if you ask me. What bothers me is the fact that Cameron wants to bring back Sigourney Weaver's character who clearly died and even Lang's character that couldn't even possibly survive those 2 arrows in the chest and even if the film ends with Jake Sully opening his eyes and becoming a full 'Avatar' the movie still doesn't need so many sequels that James Cameron is planning and that is the problem with modern Jim Cameron he is focusing on stuff that don't make sense and especially 'Avatar' that doesn't need any actual sequel and i'm concerned that this might be Cameron's first big mistake but i hope that i'm wrong. As a romance and as a drama 'Avatar' is definitely 10 times better than 'Titanic' and the same goes for it's action but when you start comparing it with T1 and T2, Aliens, True Lies or even The Abyss the movie just looses it's magic against some of 80's and 90's best films. (9/10) ",,,,,,
12,Avatar,7,1,"There is no doubt that 'Avatar' is a groundbreaking piece of cinema in terms of visual effects and cinematography. From the stunning landscapes and scenery to the design and appearance of the characters, 'Avatar' really is a visual feast and a pleasure to watch. One of the most visually spectacular films of all time.
It is, however, let down by its shallow and uninspiring storyline - a storyline that almost feels secondary to the CGI and special effects and struggles to justify the near 3 hour running length. That said, the flaws in the plot don't really take anything away from the enjoyment of this film, which is still a pleasure to watch. ",,,,,,
13,Avatar,2,0,"Sure, this film's digital CGI is dazzling on the surface, but I found that Avatar was all flash and no substance. The overuse of computer effects just came off as cheap to me, though that largely depends on the preferences of the individual viewer, and I found it impossible to relate to the characters or even to like them. Certainly a lot of undeniable hard work went into Avatar, and to be fair I don't think it's absolutely loathsome or terrible - just terribly overrated, and I'm sick of people always raving about it to me. I watched it, didn't like it, never will, nor do I need persuasion, but I can definitely appreciate that many people, especially hardcore sci-fi and fantasy fans, enjoy it, and I'm fine with that.

14,Avatar,9,1,"If the Story seems Derivative and Cliched, it is because Human Behavior, as Witnessed by History is Derivative and Cliched. In Other Words, it's Predictable.
James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is Wholly Predictable and is Dumbed Down for All to Watch and Learn, a Noble Effort considering that Not Much has been Learned from History Books and Intellectual Exercises ad nauseum.
This Engrossing Film is a Visual Treat. An Artistic Modernist Wet Dream full of Fanciful Flourishes of Day-Glo Psychedelica turning the Planet of Pandora into a Floral and Fauna Fantasyland with Inherent Illumination and Illustrious Imaginative Jungle Jive.
It's a Hoot. The ""Animals"", of Foot and Flight, are Familiar Unfamiliarities. A Cross between Earth's Prehistoric Past and Pandora's Pristine Gleam Untreated by Colonialist.
The ""Tree of Life"" for the Natives is a Tree-Huggers Heavenly Sent Icon. Awesome, Gargantuan, and according to Folklore (and as it turns out science), it is the Organic Operating System and Central Hub of Everything on the Planet.
Environmental Concerns and a Live and Let Live Philosophy are Elemental to the Sophomoric Script. The Black Hat/White Hat Characters are neither Complex nor do They Surprise. It's all just Magnificent Backdrop Eye-Candy and Dreamscape for another ""Us vs Them"".
The Movie Transports to a Realm where Humans have Traveled and Humans just do what Humans Do. This isn't the Stuff of High Intellect or PHd Thesis.
It is Storybook Adventure and while the Story is Certainly Adventurous and Captivating and quite a Roller Coaster Ride, the Detractors that Rail Against the Film's Dumb Dialog and Stereotypical People and Situations have a Point.

15,Avatar,1,0,"This movie was a complete shocker. The acting was so bad I could not stay with it. When acting is terrible it is tough to stay ""in the movie"". They really should have cast some more accomplished actors. The scenery was so terrible. It was just too fake and plastic looking for me to settle in and enjoy it.
The aspect that really got me was the predictable and boring story-line. It was so predictable that I considered switching it off numerous times. The only reason I watched the entire movie is because of the hype that it generated at the box office. Boring! ",,,,,,
16,Avatar,10,1,"This movie was more than just any other movie to me. It had amazing graphics with a beautiful planet an a huge story to it. As I was watching it I just could picture myself in the scenario. And after I watched it one night, I woke up the next morning thinking ""why is everything so dull now?"". I had just wished something like the world that is in the movie Avatar could be something in real life. Because i wake up every day after watching it thinking ""I wish I could be a part of that world.I wish it were real."" It gives me a great feeling, and every time I watch it I get goosebumps and chills. It is the best movie I have ever watched. ",,,,,,
17,Avatar,9,1,I very much enjoy watching films like this. Watching Avatar made me feel like i was on a trip to another world. The technique in this movie that made the world come together was phenomenal. From the makeup to the made up language to the physical world and the life in that world itself. I was surprised every time something new popped up. Even though there was so much to see in the movie i felt that there was still a whole world to be discovered. ,,,,,,

19,Avatar,6,1,"""Avatar"" is an American movie from 2009 and still the most recent blockbuster movie by writer and director James Cameron. He dominated the awards season over a decade earlier with ""Titanic"" already and things looked similar back in 2010 when only ""The Hurt Locker"" managed to keep ""Avatar"" from winning all the very big prizes. Ironically enough, the former was made by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow which made for some interesting references (and bad jokes) at the Oscars back then. But still ""Avatar"" won three trophies at the Oscars alone and many many more during other big awards ceremonies. There are several versions out there of this film when it comes to the runtime and the longest is probably the director's cut that comes incredibly close to the massive 3-hour mark. Your choice if you want to go for this one the original theatrical release for example. You can decide it perhaps if you plan on rewatching this extremely long and extremely blue movie before the sequels come out as it seems Cameron still wants to go through on his plan of releasing no less than four sequels to ""Avatar"" until 2025 that he has worked on in the last decade.
The cast includes Sam Worthington who is the lead actor here and it is definitely the by far biggest work of his career. Add to that Cameron's longtime collaborator Sigourney Weaver and relatively young actors like Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez or Zoe Saldana. The main antagonist is played by Stephen Lang who as usual elevates the material. Oh yeah, CCH Pounder is on board too and deserves the mention for sure. Basically, there are two kinds of people when it comes to ""Avatar"", those who really absolutely love the movie and think it is a revelation and then those who think it is all pretense and nothing special at all. So it sure is a clash of extremes and I personally would say they are both in the wrong. The right approach is somewhere in-between. ""Avatar"" is a movie that is breathtakingly beautiful on many occasions and that offers a solid story that is nothing too great though. But it also offers basically fight and war sequences for 45 minutes or so, basically the entire last third of the movie. And this is where the film somehow lost me to be honest. It is just too long for basically nothing but action scenes, even if lots of important stuff (deaths mostly) happens during that time.
As for the film's frequently discussed environmental message, I am a bit undecided. I think the general concept of showing how humans (or Naavi) should live in peace with nature and all its creatures, plants and animals, is a honorable one, but it is also pretty simple because you could wonder the extent to which the taming, i.e. the violent submission, works against this principle for example. But you could write pages on this subject to be honest, alone about this movie, and at times I must say I think it takes itself more seriously than it should give the substance it has and messages it is sending. I read frequently that people compare this film to ""Pocahontas"", but it's been so long that I have seen the latter (Have I at all?), so I cannot really elaborate on the subject. I think ""Avatar"" offers enough to enjoy the movie as its own creative achievement and even if it has sequences where it drags a bit, it is still very much worth watching, preferably on the big screen. If you have a chance to do so (again), then don't miss out. To everybody who hasn't seen ""Avatar"" yet (if there are actually people out there that fit this description), maybe wait until the new films come out and then I am sure many cinemas will show this original film before and you can watch it there and then decide if you are interested in more. This is (as almost always with Cameron) by no means an actors' movie, even if some have baity material. It is really all about the messages and the world and the environment in this movie. All about the visual side basically. A whole new world. Maybe not a whole new movie as there are considerable weaknesses in here without a doubt. One of the better, but not very best films of 2009 I would say, one that deserves neither all the hate nor all the praise it's been getting. And for closure, let me say that the song during the closing credits is also pretty amazing to listen to. ",,,,,,
20,Avatar,1,0,"This movie has already been made, it's called Dances With Wolves. Think about the two movies and you will know what I am talking about. It's also way to computer generated for me, it looks fake and stupid. It reminds me of Star Wars 1-3. The Cameron magic failed in this lame movie. There was really nothing about this movie that I liked except that Sigourney Weaver was in it. ",,,,,,
21,Amadeus,6,1,"Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche.
In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent.
The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse.
Yet his biggest rival is the only one to really recognize Mozart's abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy.
In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course. ",,,,,,
22,Amadeus,1,0,"Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world.
The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten.
The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career.
The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow.
My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca ",,,,,,
23,Amadeus,8,1," Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means ""Loved by God"" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music. ",,,,,,
24,Amadeus,2,0,"I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think.
Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside.
I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it. ",,,,,,
25,Amadeus,7,1,"Amadeus. A twisted story of the prodigy and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most brilliant composer of all time who according to this film was a young rock star who somehow wrote boozed up masterpieces all day while dealing with a persistent fever.
Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time.
Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack.
This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham.
God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender.
The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap.
The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around.
As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing...
The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup.
The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music.
Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints.

26,Amadeus,2,0," I was excited to see this film as I love Mozart, am a fan of his work and my dad said it was really good. The beginning started off fine, it was an interesting, memorable opening scene however it went downhill from there! First of all this film shouldn't be named Amadeus after Mozart it should be named after Antonio as the film is all about him! We are introduced to Mozart about 20 minutes, they cast a rubbish American actor, they should have trained him to do a German / Austrian accent, that would have made the film immediately better! Also Mozart acts like an immature retard, maybe he was like that but where is the evidence!? Also the relationship between Antonio and Mozart was ridiculous, Antonio was portrayed as if he murdered Mozart which I don't believe for a second! Overall I only gave this one more star for the music! ",,,,,,
27,Amadeus,8,1,"The life story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart told retrospectively from the perspective of his contemporary and rival, the imperial composer Antonio Salieri, who at the end of his life is confessing to a priest in a believe that he is responsible for Mozarts death. Most of the story shows last years of Mozarts life, his character, his career, his personal life and his death. The technical part is done well, especially the scenery that makes a visual impression fantastic. Mozart's music is blended into the content of the film and is a great foundation for consistently strong atmosphere. It's a shame that some potentially great scenes were somewhat ruined with very bad camera work although Forman generally did very good job. Besides the historical inaccuracies that pervade the entire film, bad reactions were provoked by the choice of Tom Hulce as Mozart. Tom did great job, he gave his best and probably did all that was asked of him but he's just not suited for the role. Shaffer and Forman vision of Mozart is maybe correct, but it certainly is different from vision of biggest par of the audience. F. Murray Abraham is brilliant in the lead role of Antonio Salieri and was rewarded for it with Oscar and a Golden Globe. The movie won 8 Oscars and it's shares that number with movies like Gandhi and Gone With the Wind. The screenplay is very good in almost every aspect besides historical inaccuracies. The characters are wonderfully developed, the dialogues are strong and most importantly the story keeps viewers to the screen for the entire 160 minutes. This is one of the titles that absolutely no one should miss, but either before or after viewing, it may be good to read historically accurate story. ",,,,,,
28,Amadeus,10,1,"Why would any actor perform to the best of their amazing abilities in a fabulous, moving movie just to then perform in mainly mediocre movies later on then retire from the world stage? Ending on a good note is good for a mediocre actor (cue Kristen Stewart, Please!!!) but I felt that Tom Hulce had so much more to give.
With Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) giving us the prologue, the story is based on Salieri's jealousy and envy for Mozart. Mozart (Tom Hulce) is about to compose a piece at a palace in Vienna (Home of the musicians). Whilst eager to meet Mozart, expecting him to be a talented, humble and grateful young man, discovers that he is actually a lewd, immature deviant. After witnessing Mozart perform, then seeing him memorise an entire piece of Salieri's music almost instantly then play it to him, he grows jealous of Mozart as he realises that god has chosen a simple, undeserving boy rather than a devout, dedicated religious musician (himself) to be bestowed with such talent. Salieri then devises a plan to get Mozart to write an absolutely perfect piece of music, his requiem mass, then dispose of Mozart and take the credit for it. He would finally gain his victory over Mozart as he will dispose of him and god as he must now watch Salieri get the recognition he finally deserves. Only time will tell if it will work...
There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. Coming from me, thats a rarity (check out my other reviews, I'm not kidding I always find something negative apart from AC3). Every actor is brilliant and as I mentioned Tom Hulce is amazing and I can't understand why he retired so soon. In short this movie is well worth seeing time and time again. I love this movie purely for the beauty and musical passion that goes into every scene.
Amadeus will always be renowned as a classic and I am telling you to see it to truly appreciate it's amazement. I place this movie at number 4 of my personal top 20 movies. ",,,,,,
29,Amadeus,9,1,"The film is filled with music. At first thought this thing could resist people to watch the film. But it is unbelievable that opera can be so much beautiful. The film is a must watch for everyone or I would say an important film. Because it is about Mozart, the name that we all have heard since childhood. The length of the film is long. I watched the director's cut which is about 3 hours and to watch a film 3 hours long I had to think a lot before watching. But I must say that it was 3 hours of pure fun. The acting from both the main characters is superb. The story keeps you attached to the film always(mainly because of the acting.). Then at some point of times you will find opera shown at length and the interesting fact is that you will like it. I must say it was 3 hours well spent.
""A must watch for each and everyone."" ",,,,,,
30,Amadeus,10,1," The story of what music meant to an aging ""Patron Saint of Mediocrity"" told to a young priest by our afflicted Soliere after being committed to a sanitarium. This ranks as my top musically oriented masterpiece. The symphonies and operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart hauntingly decorate the jealous and humorous results of those surrounding the King and his minions in their attempts to corral the young, but gifted, composer. Tom Hulce (as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) is absolutely passionate about his perfect music and F. Murray Abrahams' Soliere is a genuine gift in expressing many a musicians frustration of never reaching Gods' ears with ones works. The idea of mediocrity being a sin is expressed by our anti-hero so well at the end that I always reflect on my own limited musical expressions. Well, there it tis! ",,,,,,
31,The Matrix Revolutions,1,0,"What was the point of this trilogy? Why take the pill to begin with? What were they fighting for? In the end the free humans settle for survival, and trade slavery for the rest of humanity for their own survival. If ""peace"" is the most important thing, why start the fight? In the first movie they tell us that freedom is the most important thing--without it you aren't really alive. It's worth giving up your life in the matrix; it's worth living a life underground in sewers and caves; it's worth fighting and dying for. By the third movie freedom wasn't as important as any of that. Leave humanity in bondage to the machines. Leave the matrix running and leave the free people in their caves. Just give us peace.
There was so much promise. Not only did the Wachowskis not meet that promise, they wimped out completely. ",,,,,,
32,The Matrix Revolutions,1,0,"After protesting for as long as I could, my brother convinced me to see the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, The Matrix Revolutions. I will begin by saying that I was a big fan of the first film, and was curious to see how the story would end. I went into the movie with as open a mind as I could, but after the first forty-five minutes I was just angry at how bad the movie really was.
It was at this point that Neo was reunited with Trinity after being held by the ""Frenchman"" in a sort of limbo (in this case it was a white on white on white train station.) This story line was entirely useless, especially since the conflict was resolved and served no point in the rest of the movie, except to introduce a cute little girl who is a machine, a useless program going on to live with the Oracle. (I lie, this story-line also gave the Wachowski brothers an excuse to film both a bondage night club and Monica Belucci's ample cleavage.)
The movie goes on from there building up tension and ""drama"" that leads up to the breaching of the last human city, Zion. Another thing I do not understand is why the humans want to be free? The Matrix is a much better place to live than the real world, which is dark and cold and only hospitable under the ground. The people here have reverted to a new religion and to wearing horrifically unflattering clothing. Why would they choose this life of constant turmoil and darkness over the life of at least supposed happiness in the matrix?
The movie builds up to two climaxes, one involving Neo in the Machine City and another involving the rest of mankind in Zion. In the end there is a depressingly anti-climatic battle in Zion where lots of stuff blows up real good, and not one person shows a single emotion. It is as if the directors told each actor to choose an emotion and facial expression to go along with that emotion and to stick with it. Watch closely Morpheus and Trinity for an example of this.
Neo ends up having to fight the billions of Agents Smiths that have taken over the Matrix. If he wins, there will be peace, if not Zion will be destroyed. Since it all comes down to this battle, then what was the point of the rest of the movie? Especially the drawn out battle scene that precedes the films second climax? It is enough to make a person mad.
In the end Neo of course defeats Smith in a manner that made no sense to me or my brother. Peace is declared and the Matrix trilogy comes to the most infuriating happy ending ever in the history of movies.
Earlier I said that I was a fan of the first film, that has all changed because of what the Matrix went on to become. With the first film, they made history, but with the second two the Wachowski's have committed murder. The special effects in the second two movies are not eve as impressive, especially in Revolutions (never before have I seen a more boring gun fight!) This movie is infuriating and poorly written with so/so special effects and some of the worst acting ever captured o film (Yes, I am including the Star Wars Prequels). Skip this movie, skip Reloaded and simply watch the Matrix on DVD. It is far better. ",,,,,,
33,The Matrix Revolutions,10,1,"Matrix Revolutions is a revolution of a movie and shows that the brothers wont stop at a half worked job. the attention to detail and cinematography of the real world makes you shocked at how much work was really put into this film. In my opinion no one will be able to match the hugeness of the matrix trilogy for a long time. a job well done and a movie definitely worth seeing, even if you didn't like the 2nd one. ",,,,,,
34,The Matrix Revolutions,8,1,"Going into this movie I had one wish: To leave feeling that it was a successful conclusion to a two-part film. Taking Reloaded/Revolutions as a single (very large) movie with an intermission is the best way to evaluate it. Viewed that way I think it succeeded. I thought Revolutions was the equal of Reloaded, yet I can see how many will think it failed. The ending gave us everything we needed to know, but did not show us all we wanted to see. I'm speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here. After a visually robust middle, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once, the ending seemed like an anticlimax. It needed to be longer, and I would gladly have traded some of the fx flair used earlier to give the final part of the film it's justified due. It will be awhile before I can look at it more objectively (perhaps I'll have to wait to view the two parts as one on DVD). I only suggest now that anyone seeing it let it sink in completely before being too critical. ",,,,,,
35,The Matrix Revolutions,5,0,"This movie looks and sounds like the Wachowski Brothers abandoned it. It degenerates from their previous successes, like they were running out of ideas and decided to fall back to previous scenes and dialogue.
The nowhere more apparent than in the script. I wanted to tally how many times the captain of the Hammer said ""He's out of his goddamn mind"". Or ""Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you"". The Wachowski Brothers really dropped the ball when writing this movie. They recycled so much dialogue from Reloaded becomes almost painful to hear. The cast itself seemed like they just stopped giving a damn. I groaned by the time Trinity's second monologue of the film rolled around.
I have an opinion that it would have been better if Trinity had died in Reloaded. It would've been something to drive Neo towards victory, and given Morpheus something better to do than be ordered around by Niobe. The siege of Zion, while good independent of the series, was a mistake. Matrix-fans demand Matrix stuff, and most of the movie wasn't in the Matrix. The stuff that was in the Matrix, was disappointing. The gun-check room was a complete rip off of the lobby scene from the first movie. I was really looking forward to Neo and Smith's final battle. I anticipated the fight scene in Matrix history. What I got was Dragonball Z, the movie. It wasn't a true fight. It was two inhumanly tough guys kicking and punching each other to no apparent end. And the way they killed Neo, was a complete let down. You've given us a great character, at least give him a dignified death.
The only redeeming quality of this movie were the special effects, which were near flawless. But really, this movie should have been thirty minutes shorter and a lot cooler. I think they should tied Neo's confrontation to the battle for Zion. Instead we can an ending of some more philosophical babble and a stupid kid saying the war is over. That irritated me to no end.
One thing that must be noted, this is a Matrix movie. Or was. Instead they turned it into a bad hash of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Bible, and DBZ. People don't come to the movies to think, they come to be entertained, to relax, to blow off some steam and eat some bloody popcorn. I don't the spend the week studying, go to see an action movie on the weekend, and expect to new age Zen crap shoved down my throat.
Wachowski Brothers, if you make any movies in the future, remember three things: 1) Don't loose sight of your core audience, 2)Don't turn an hour and a half action movie into a two and a half hour pseudo-philosophical action movie, 3)Hire new writers.",,,,,,
36,The Matrix Revolutions,7,1,"""The Matrix, Revolutions"" was not on the level with the original, this much is true. However, it was undoubtedly a large step in the right direction.
To start with the most praise-worthy aspect of ""Revolutions"", being that of visuals. From a visual standpoint this movie was amazing, the CGI was unrivaled by anything that had ever come before it. The final battle between Smith and Neo easily places itself somewhere in my three favorite cinematic sequences of all time. And the battle between the machines and humans in Zion is also jaw-dropping. From a purely visual standpoint this movie is simply the best of three (which is boasting a lot since the free-way chase in the sub par ""Reloaded"" was quite the sight itself). The CGI is probably the best in any movie ever made, a notch above ""Reloaded"", which at times felt as though it were a video game, and worlds ahead of any of the recent Star War's movies.
Another improvement that was made upon the previous installments of the series was the music. Gone are cheesy techno theme's and watered-down POD lyrics. Instead we get to feast upon more gospel and, dare I say, epic themed musical backgrounds. Epic, as it would turn out, is the word that could best describe the feel of this final Matrix chapter, the entire time you feel as though you are engaged in something epic and important.
The acting is right back where it should have been in the second one, as all characters are portrayed better by their respective actors/actresses. Fishburne provides us with probably his strongest performance of the three, he is in a the role of a more emotional Morpheus then we have seen before. And it certainly turns out to be a role that he seems comfortable in. Reeves and Moss also both seem to be right back in their acting grooves (this is of course assuming Keanu ever had one). Also, Agent Smith definitely is the strongest character in this movie, the acting is right-on and the character is developed to completely new heights as true sadistic colors come out completely for the viewer to enjoy.
The only complaints that can be made are about the over done philisophical conversations and the movie's open ended conclusion. ""Revolutions"" at times feels as though it is trying too hard to be intellectual. Impending death does not need to make everybody do their best Plato impersonations. And in the end you may feel as though the movie has left you as clueless as when the series first began... Then again, you may also feel as though you have figured it all out. But irregardless the future of The Matrix is left up in the air.
In the end, ""Revolutions"" will be hated by some people and loved by others, there will be no gray here. It is hard not to measure it up to the first Matrix, which leaves it looking slightly wanting. However, it turns out to be thousands of times better then ""Reloaded"" (which I feel was a solid flick itself!) And one thing that the open ended conclusion does do for me, is fill me with hope that the journey down the rabbit hole is not yet over. ",,,,,,
37,The Matrix Revolutions,4,0,"The Matrix:Reloaded was good. Not as good as I would have liked, but good nevertheless. Revolutions was unfortunately many degrees below that standard. The feeling I got throughout the entire film was that the Wachowski's had the phrase ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" on their minds, and due to the success of the first film, nobody would stand up to them and say that, well, actually, it would be pretty cheesy. There are so many scenes that are just awful cliched nonsense. I hope that in ten years time, as happened with the Highlander series, somebody will come along and pretend that these original sequels never existed and create some new ones following on from the first film.
Too many characters with too little substance. Scenes based on effects instead of story, characters based on ability rather than being interesting. A pile of rubbish really. ",,,,,,
38,The Matrix Revolutions,1,0,"I watched the movie expecting a classic Hollywood ending, i suppose; where the good guys survive and beat the bad guys. Though the ending was different than i expected, it was far from refreshing. First of all, i didn't see the point of killing Trinity. It really gutted me to see her die, as she was my favorite character. They could have killed everyone else but Neo and Trinity and i would have been OK with it. So could anyone tell me what the Wachowski brothers might have been thinking when they killed her off? I was very disappointed by this final addition to the trilogy, and would much rather it had turned out different. From the moment Neo was blinded, dread crept into my heart and didn't leave. As the credits rolled on, i felt thoroughly depressed and amazed at the way the Wachowski brothers had decided to wrap up their amazing story. Could anyone help enlighten me on the reasons for their making it this way?? ",,,,,,
39,The Matrix Revolutions,1,0,"I see that I am not alone, other people were dissapointed with this pathetic,decidely tawdry attempt at a film. The first movie had the right aesthetic blend of visuals coupled with some interesting philosophical questioning. Matrix 3 Revolutions does not have a single bone of originality contained within its rather sad, scrawny little frame. Instead it is reduced to the self referential, with the same moves and same scenes from the original film being endlessly repeated. Transparently the film grafts off ideas from the Star Wars movie's in terms of not only themes - (the flight of the nebuchednezzar through the dimly lit tunnels of Zion will remind many film aficianados of the millenium falcon's journey through the Death Star in Return Of The Jedi) - but music, too. The hydraulically devised robotic suits that the defenders of Zion don to defend their city from the enemy are blatant derivatives of the loader mechanism used by Ripley in Alien. The action sequences are disparately littered throughout the course of this nearly three hour film, with the majority of its content being devoted to mind numbingly boring exchanges between Neo and Trinity, Neo and Oracle etc (you know the drill: dull, soporific dialogues along the lines of 'Ah, but Neo you know', 'ah, but I don't', 'but you do really'...just get to the f*****g point Oracle. If you know the answer just tell him!) Who did they hire to write this godawful mess, the scriptwriters of Sunset Beach?
Revolutions: it might just make you dizzy...spend your five pounds on something worthwhile like 'Watching Paint Dry Weekly', you might get more of an adrenaline kick out of it! 0.5 out of ten! ",,,,,,
40,The Matrix Revolutions,3,0,"Who are the Wachowski brothers fooling ? After delivering ""Matrix"", which rightfully became a world wide success, they immediately claimed that they had had the concept for three films right from the beginning. HAHA ! What had already started with ""Matrix Reloaded"" - a lot of people were disappointed but still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt - has now reached an absolute nadir. ""Matrix Revolutions"" is an incoherent, jumbled, meaningless mess that has to be seen to be believed ! Approach with extreme caution !!! ",,,,,,
41,The Expendables I,4,0," The subtitling of a Somali pirate's English in the opening scenes of The Expendables is understandable, it's just a pity that they didn't keep the subtitles going for the other 100 minutes, because a substantial portion of the grunting and growling that passes for dialogue is unintelligible. This would be a problem if anything that was being said was important or required for understanding of the plot, but it isn't, because the plot is a straight line from A to B, entirely one dimensional, so you can fill in the gaps yourself, if you even notice them. On the subject of sound, it is even more uneven than your standard Hollywood blockbuster, but you are not missing much by dialling things down to save your eardrums during the action sequences. There's an amiable buddy-buddy bonhomie running through the script that is enjoyable, and the action well done, and includes the best water plane escape scene since Raiders of the Lost Ark, but overall The Expendables is cliched and predictable. That's all very well, regrettable, but not objectionable, and it seems clear that this was the film's low-set aspiration anyway, however when you are literally falling asleep during the 'climactic' assault on the evil general's headquarters, I think you can safely say that the film's value as mindless entertainment, it's only real selling point, is limited. ",,,,,,
42,The Expendables I,7,1,"Expendables was not exactly my favorite but I would have to say that for the most part it was a decent action movie. With the amount of actors that were cast in this movie that had huge success in other franchises it was a little bit of a disappointment for me to see this movie at the level it was. I would have expected better.
That being said, there are a few scenes that I found pretty good. Incidentally these are the most action packed scenes of the entire movie. Go figure.
The first scene I liked was when Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) fly down to Vilena, an island in the Gulf of Mexico (fictional, of course). They are doing reconnaissance for a job to take out the dictator of the island. Ross and Christmas witness local soldiers terrorizing the citizens of the island and being directed by James Munroe (Eric Roberts) and Paine (Steve Austin). The best part of the whole scene is when Ross and Christmas escape the island, but end up taking out the dock area they landed their plane. The do this, Christmas first fires Browning M2 Aircraft machine guns quad-mounted into the nose of the plane. Then fuel is dumped on the dock, dousing the remaining soldiers and Munroe and Paine, Christmas then fires a M8 Flare Pistol at the dock to ignite the fuel.
The next scene I liked was when Christmas gets home he goes over to his girlfriend's house only to find that she, Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) is seeing another guy. Lacy explains that she only moved on because even when Christmas was home he wasn't really home, and that she really didn't know him. But the best scene for this little triangle is when Christmas goes to Lacy's house and discovers that her boyfriend, Paul (Hank Amos), has hit Lacy. Christmas and Lacy get on his motorcycle to go have a chat with Paul. Paul is playing basketball with a five or six other guys when Lacy and Christmas show up. Christmas takes out every single one of them, leaving them alive, but tells Paul that the next time he comes near Lacy and lays a hand on her he will deflate all of Paul's balls.
The best scene by far is the scene in which Ross and Christmas, along with the other members of their mercenary force, storm the President's Palace on Vilena. They are doing this to take out the dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), as well as Munroe and Paine. They are also trying to rescue Sandra (Giselle Itie'), General Garza's daughter. Near the end of the scene Munroe has a gun pointed at Sandra and he asks Ross why he was coming after him; Ross answers that he was coming for the girl not him, and then shoots Munroe several times before Christmas throws a knife through his chest.
Another great scene is the chase scene through the city the Expendables live in. I hate that the 1955 Ford 100 truck that Barney Ross was driving got destroyed, I like older vehicles like that one. The fight between Yin Yang (Jet Li) and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) at the end of this chase scene was pretty cool.
I think I named all the headliners. Oh wait! I forgot Bruce Willis as Church and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench, they weren't in the movie for very long, a total of about 7 or 8 minutes.
Anyway, this could have been a hell of a lot better. The graphics, especially the blood splatter from gun shot wounds, was exaggerated; probably to allow for better visual effect, but it looked fake. I guess that was the point. A lot of the weapons were pretty cool. I like the weapon that Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) used. Sorry, I forgot a headliner.
The script was OK. Tool's (Mickey Rourke) story of being in Bosnia (?) was touching, especially when he started to get choked up.
Anyway, I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars. It could have been way better. ",,,,,,
43,The Expendables I,1,0,"Truly awful film, with uninspired action, and acting from most of the cast which is just as bad.
There are certainly lots of explosions and guns, but sadly the screenplay - which could have been described as one big cliche if it had made enough sense to gain even that distinction - is truly rotten.
Even as a brainless action film it fails, due to uninspired fight scenes and hyper-frenetic editing, which leaves you with little clue of exactly what is going on a lot of the time.
It also includes the most unexplained, senseless, and unbelievable forgiveness of a character which I can remember seeing.
Written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, he unintentionally proves himself a relic of the sort of all brawn, no brains, chauvinistic films which would be better left in the past. ",,,,,,
44,The Expendables I,6,1," Given the amount of 80's action movie geek enthusiasm I had in anticipation of this movie, i was surprised at how little amount of fun i had watching it. It seems Stallone wasn't quite up to the admittedly Hurculean task of writing/directing/starring in The Expendables. There were too few great moments of interaction between the characters, not enough witty banter, not enough chemistry between the characters. Having seen the making of and behind the scenes footage of the expendables, it seems like Sly relied too heavily upon ad-libbing and improvisational dialogue due to his guerrilla style film-making approach. The action scenes were pretty forgettable, with the notable exception of the dual 50 cal/ flare gun dock explosion scene. Stallone and Statham get top billing and screen time, but Mickey Rourke steals the show with his dialogue on salvation and damnation. Dolph Lundgren upstages everyone else with his sheer presence alone. Jet Li's character gets some good screen time and one of the films best fight sequences, but again his dialogue is awkwardly written. Eric Roberts does an adequate job in the villain role, but couldn't they have found a better actor to go up against this dream team of Hollywood titans? The rest of the cast is generally pushed aside and given only brief screen time which fails to leave much of an impression. Sadly the entire thing manages to underwhelm and seems to underline the fact that most of these guys best days are behind them. Which is a shame when so many of us fans were hoping for a glorious return to form. Still, The Expendables is worth watching, just keep your expectations realistic. 6/10. ",,,,,,
45,The Expendables I,10,1," Sylvester Stallone,Jason Statham,Jet Lee,Dolph Lundgren,Bruce Willis Terry Crews,Randy Couture,Steve Austin that was awesome cast and movie and i love Expendables franchise 1 and 2 were both awesome and i love the action scenes guns,knifes,glory,funny and i love ideas on this movie when Stallone said it is to heavy then he gives the rocket to terry then Stallone Shoot's it then destroyers the Helicopter. and i love action scenes with Dolph and Jet when they fighting in 2 scenes i think it was awesome i wish Stallone add more of action films and the actors were not in many parts of movie i remember meeting fans saying all you need 5 guys i am like this is big movie big cast should be fighting in big action movie and this movie a bit like Rambo 4 the violet parts and kinda same place but different country and place i love showdown parts with randy fighting with Steve Austin and you see him burn then randy jumps and punch's him in face then he dies wow ! great actions and mickey Rourke didn't do much in this movie and Bruce Willis and Arnold not much the rest did a lot of action in this movie i love it 10/10 ",,,,,,
46,The Expendables I,8,1,"The Expendables is a fantastic movie with a good storyline and a very strong cast that know how to act in an action movie.The movie is action packed from start to finish,and some scenes are so brutal you'd want to look away from it,a very impressive job from Sylvester Stallone.The cast of the movie is incredible,Sylvester Stallone,Jason Statham,Jet Li and even Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger make a cameo appearance,but I was disappointed they didn't stay longer because their characters strong personality was very promising.I would highly recommend the Expendables to all action movie fans,it won't disappoint.
Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone),a CIA operative starts a team to take down an evil dictator and an even worse CIA agent that has betrayed his country,they also must save the dictators daughter from being killed. ",,,,,,
47,The Expendables I,1,0,"Basically a weird action romp, with terrible acting, and a lot of mumbling on Stallone's part. Another thing that will creep you out is that Stallone is wearing heavy makeup, enough to compete with a porcelain doll. That face is melting.
The only highlights of the movie was Batista's daughter, Batista, Statham, Statham's girlfriend, Jet Li, Lundgren.
But seeing them wasn't enough to balance-out the terror I felt when looking at whatever Stallone has become.
I hope you don't watch this movie. I watched this title because Jackie Chan confirmed that he will be in the third one. Maybe he can save the franchise? ",,,,,,

49,The Expendables I,3,0,"I've never been a big fan of 80s actions movies. Rambo never interested me, Demolition Man and Cliffhanger weren't even on my radar. I'd seen a few of Schwarzenegger's movies but most of them in his appeal to kids phase until I went back in the 90s and saw a few of his more popular films. Die Hard with a Vengeance was probably the only of the series that really spoke to me for a long time. So it's not as if I haven't seen my fair share of movies from that era but they never really did much for me as films. I never had that ""Wow that was so cool I want to do that moment."" that a lot of filmmakers have with them. Maybe it's because as a child of the 90s I spent a lot of my 80s years watching John Hughes films and the huge swath of comedies from that era.
Yet when I heard about The Expendables, I was somewhat intrigued. Despite my lack of affinity for their heyday they had never really been in the same place all at once before and so I was very interested in seeing what would happen. Not as it turns out enough interest to actually go see the film in theatres. I had enough misgivings about the film to wait until it came out on DVD to see it, and in doing so I realize that I was right. The film, like many of the era these films harken back to, just doesn't have enough juice in it to sustain a whole hour much less the under 2 hours the film actually has. The characters are underdeveloped and some are basically useless plot devices, the villain is basically half-assed and under used, and the only decent story worth telling was given to a secondary character and not followed through on.
Charisma Carpenter and Giselle Itie had the best stories to tell and yet the majority of screen time went to Stallone and his rag tag band of mercenaries who basically spent all their time standing around looking old and shooting people. You gotta do more with your characters then complain and destroy things to keep modern audiences interested and the only two ladies of the bunch provided the depth and emotional honesty necessary to make the extended action scenes work. Unfortunately depth and emotional honesty are not the point of a film like this and so they get relegated to C plot devices when the A and B plots haven't been any more secured then the plan to liberate an island by blowing up a single part of it with barely any of the army which is holding it hostage insid
What made most of the 80s action movies work was the buddy cop scenario or the damsel in distress scenario, both of which are present in The Expendables but neither of which are particularly well used. You would think with this many 80s action stars in one room who have played out the stories numerous times would know a thing or two about what works and what doesn't work about a film like this and insist on making it better. Stallone in particular given that he is one of the only of the group to win a Best Picture Oscar. But no, the film is a hap hazard attempt to give many of its stars who have been relegated to direct to DVD content a chance to shine on the big screen. Unfortunately they don't really shine all that brightly, if at all.
What do you need to turn a group of 80s action stars into Expendables? You put them in a movie together with a barely there plot and tell them to act like it's 20 years ago.",,,,,,
50,The Expendables I,6,1,"What do you get when you put almost every action star from the past 20 years in the same movie? You get The Expendables and you feel like a complete man watching it. The cast includes Stallone, Statham, Li, Austin, Crews, Couture, Rourke, Willis, Schwarzenegger, and my personal favorite Lundgren. In case you don't know who he is he is Drago from Rocky 4. I heard some people complain that the movie was stupid and had no story and point. To that I say, duh, that's not the point. This is a once in a lifetime franchise and for what it's worth it was fine.
This is a straight up action movie and has no other point then to see your favorite stars blow things up and kill people. The story is crazy, but who cares. I did not go see this movie for deep characters and an in-depth storyline. I saw this for the action and special effects. For an action movie, I loved it, for a movie in general, it was one of the worst I have ever seen. Stallone leads a group of mercenaries and he gets too attached to a job and he wants to return to rescue a girl. I guess the first rule of being a mercenary is not to get attached to the job. It's get in, get out, and get paid. For what it is it wasn't a terrible idea. If it had to be a story I'm glad it was this one.
A major flaw with the move itself is the fact that it tries too hard to be a movie that it isn't. After an action packed opener they go back home and try to dig into characters and that's not necessarily a bad thing but they tried too hard. Stallone has his internal conflict and talks it over with Rourke, and that's OK, but the whole story with Statham and his girlfriend could have been cut out and replaced with him snapping necks. I don't want to see Bruce Li complain about his family that doesn't exist or Mickey Rourke being completely useless throughout the entire movie. I hated his character. All he does is ride in, be a sad old man, and give tattoos. He tells this story about an old job and how he got attached to it and I was just turned off. I wanted him out of the movie. He is an action star and should have been that. Instead he was a has-been and drags the movie along. Even Stallone looked like he was getting bored. Bruce Willis' character was OK, I wanted to see him kill people too but instead he plays the guy who assigns the job and that's it. Anybody could have played that role and he was wasted as a name to promote the movie. I was OK with Schwarzenegger's character because he was governor at the time so it made sense. I guess I should praise the real point of the movie, the action. Nothing made me happier than seeing Terry Crews mow people down with a shotgun. The car chase with Stallone, Li, and Lundgren was impressive. It had the stupid one liner but cars flipping and bullets flying are what I wanted to see. Some of these actors are getting old but the gritty hand to hand combat still held up. The explosions in the beginning were just as good as the ones at the end. Stone Cold Steve Austin is in the movie as a bad guy and he fit in surprisingly well. He played a bad guy in the WWF so he knows what he is doing. His scenes were fun to watch and he was a good addition. Overall, The Expendables was exactly what I expected. It was a battle of men and a movie for a man. If you took your girlfriend to see this movie, I hope she broke up with you on the spot. The acting was gross, he story was choppy and stupid, but that wasn't the point. When people tell me this movie was bad I laugh and ask what they expected. I expected the bloodbath that I got so I was happy. As a movie it is terrible, but as an action movie it is top notch. The Expendables gets the WillyT Bloodbath Badge. That basically means it was a good action movie. If I had to give it a real WillyT Rating it gets the WillyT Recommendation because it is a movie every man needs to see to consider himself a man. ",,,,,,
